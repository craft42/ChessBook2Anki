# ♟️ Chess2Anki - Generate Anki decks from chessboard images

This project automates the creation of Anki flashcards from chess puzzle images taken from books or screenshots. Each image contains a chessboard and a solution written below it.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Automatically reads chess images (board + solution)
- Recognizes the chessboard and converts it into FEN
- Extracts the textual solution using OCR
- Generates a `.csv` file compatible with Anki:
  - Column 1: image path generated from FEN
  - Column 2: solution extracted from image

## 🛠️ Installation

### 📦 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-user/chess2anki.git
cd chess2anki
```

### 🤖 2. Chessboard Recognizer

The `chessboard-recognizer` (from [linrock](https://github.com/linrock/chessboard-recognizer)) is already integrated in this repository.  
You don't need to install it separately — just make sure the script `recognize.py` and the `nn/` model folder are included.

> If `nn/` is missing, download the release `nn.zip` from the [official releases](https://github.com/linrock/chessboard-recognizer/releases), unzip it, and place it inside the project directory.

### 🔍 3. Install Tesseract OCR

- **Windows**:  
  Download from [UB Mannheim builds](https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki)  
  During setup, check the language(s) you need (e.g. English, French).  
  Default install path: `C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR`

- **macOS**:  
  Install via Homebrew:

  ```bash
  brew install tesseract
  ```

- **Linux (Debian/Ubuntu)**:
  
  ```bash
  sudo apt install tesseract-ocr
  ```

### 💡 4. Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended)

#### Windows (Virtual Environment)
